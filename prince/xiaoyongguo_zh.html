<h2 class="section">Personal Projects</h2>

<p> 
I develop small software in my spare time simply for fun.
The following are a few of them:
</p>

<ul>

      <li><strong><a href="https://code.google.com/p/visual-pattern-communications/">visual pattern communications</a> - </strong> Using computer screen as the signal transmitter and camera as the signal receiver for data transmission. Binary data is encoded into a sequence of QR code which is displayed on the screen frame by frame and captured by camera on another computer. Currently the data transmission rate is slightly more than 4KB/s.  </li>

      <li><strong>data communication over voice channel - </strong> Using frequency-shift-keying modulation scheme to transform binary data into voice signal. Voice signal is fed into soundcard and transmitted via audio cable or over the air via speaker (use microphone as receiver). </li>

      <li><strong>ripple effect simulation - </strong> display visual effection of ripples on any picture by solving the 2D wave equation. </li>

      <li><strong>web media capture - </strong> a simple web proxy run locally and examines all the received web contents, pick up those interesting contents like pictures or videos and save them on disk.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gxyos/">gxyos</a> - </strong> A very simple operating system developed for better understanding of x86 architecture and internals of OS kernel.</li>

</ul>
