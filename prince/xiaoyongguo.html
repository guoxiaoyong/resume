<h2 class="section">Professional Experience</h2>


<div class="experience_item">
<p>
<span class="position">Quantitative Analyst and Developer</span><br/>
<span class="employer">MQT Investment, LLC</span><br/>
<span class="period_location">October 2015 – Present | Shanghai City, China </span>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Responsible for developing API adaptors for algorithmic trading strategies. 
        Familiar with the following trading APIs commonly used in China: CTP, LTS, XSpeed, REM, Zeusing.</li>
    <li>Responsible for developing pricing models for OTC options.</li>
    <li>Responsible for developing option arbitrage strategies.</li>
    <li>Responsible for developing option market-maker system.</li>
    <li>Responsible for Linux system and network administration such as setting up network switch, firewalls, routing tables etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
MQT is a very small startup company. I work here as a Linux C++ developer and a quantitative analyst. I had no experience and knowledge in finance prior joining this company. After working here for a few months, I learned about futures, options pricing, volatility, greeks, arbitrage and hedging. The strength of my background in mathematics, signal processing and software engineering is very beneficial for me to understand complex mathematical models/algorithms and implement them in software.

<h2 class="section">Personal Projects</h2>

<p> 
I develop small software in my spare time simply for fun.
The following are a few of them:
</p>

<ul>

      <li><strong><a href="https://code.google.com/p/visual-pattern-communications/">visual pattern communications</a> - </strong> Using computer screen as the signal transmitter and camera as the signal receiver for data transmission. Binary data is encoded into a sequence of QR code which is displayed on the screen frame by frame and captured by camera on another computer. Currently the data transmission rate is slightly more than 4KB/s.  </li>

      <li><strong>data communication over voice channel - </strong> Using frequency-shift-keying modulation scheme to transform binary data into voice signal. Voice signal is fed into soundcard and transmitted via audio cable or over the air via speaker (use microphone as receiver). </li>

      <li><strong><a href="http://guoxiaoyong.com/ripple.apk">ripple effect simulation</a> - </strong> display visual effection of ripples on any picture by solving the 2D wave equation. </li>

      <li><strong><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gxyos/">gxyos</a> - </strong> A very simple operating system developed for better understanding of x86 architecture and internals of OS kernel.</li>

</ul>
